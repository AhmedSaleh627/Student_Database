# Student Database System

This project is a student database system implemented in C programming language utilizing the concept of linked lists for data storage. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding new students, deleting existing students, updating student information, and displaying the entire student database.

## Features:
- **Add Student**: Users can add new student records to the database by providing details such as student ID, name, age, and grade.
- **Delete Student**: Existing student records can be deleted from the database based on the student ID.
- **Update Student Information**: Users can update the information of existing students including their name, age, and grade.
- **Display Student Database**: The system provides functionality to display the complete list of students along with their details.
- **Search Student**: Users can search for a specific student in the database based on their student ID.

## Implementation:
The student database system is implemented using linked lists data structure. Each node in the linked list represents a student record containing fields for student ID, name, age, and grade. The system employs dynamic memory allocation to manage the memory efficiently.
